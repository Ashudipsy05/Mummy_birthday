A POEM FOR YOU 

A motherâ€™s love, so pure, so deep,
A gentle touch, a dream to keep.
Her voice, a melody soft and bright,
Guiding us through the darkest night.

Her hands, the ones that heal and hold,
Her heart, a treasure, richer than gold.
Through every storm, through joy and pain,
She stands beside, through sun and rain.

No crown she wears, no throne she owns,
Yet in her arms, the world is shown.
For every tear, for every smile,
She walks with us, each endless mile.

Oh, Mother dear, so strong, so true,
No words can tell our love for you.
Forever bright, forever near, 


                                 OH MY DEAR MUMMYYYY......!!!!
